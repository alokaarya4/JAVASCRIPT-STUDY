/*                                        VARIABLES          


-> Variable :- variables are used to store data in memory.

   1. const :- naver change
   2. let :- Changes Only Inside The Block
   3. var :- In future we can change the value in Everywhere. (Not Recommended)


  -> diffrence between let and var.
      
        1. var is function scope. {} block scope. (The Var Caused Changes Everywhere)
        2. let The Let Caused Changes Only Inside The Block
